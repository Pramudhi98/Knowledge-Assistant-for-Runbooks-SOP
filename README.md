# Knowledge-Assistant-for-Runbooks-SOP
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that helps engineers instantly access internal support documentation, such as runbooks and SOPs, by simply typing natural language queries. The system uses RAG to retrieve relevant content from markdown and PDF files and generate accurate, grounded responses using a large language model (LLM).
